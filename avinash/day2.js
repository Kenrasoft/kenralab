/* 
1. Rewrite using Conditional operator:
a.
let x = 5;

if (x > 0) {
    console.log("Positive");
} else if (x < 0) {
    console.log("Negative");
} else {
    console.log("Zero");
}
    
b.
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("Eligible to vote");
} else {
    console.log("Not eligible to vote");
}

2. 
a. Logical OR (||):
    Question:
    Write an if statement that checks if a variable value is either null or undefined.

    Question:
    Write a condition using || that assigns a default value of 10 to a variable count if it is falsy.

    Question:
    Check if a user has provided a valid email address. If not, use a default email address.

b. Logical AND (&&):
    Question:
    Write an if statement that checks if a number is greater than 10 and less than 20.

    Question:
    Implement a condition using && that prints "Login successful" only if both the username and password are valid.

    Question:
    Check if a person is eligible to vote based on age (18 or older) and citizenship.

c. Nullish Coalescing Operator (??):
    Question:
    Use the nullish coalescing operator to assign a default value of "Guest" to a variable username if it is null or undefined.

    Question:
    Implement a condition using ?? to set the value of result to 0 if value is null or undefined.

    Question:
    Check if a variable price is defined. If not, set it to the default value of 100 using the nullish coalescing operator.

4. Write a JavaScript program that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 20 (inclusive). For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz." However, if a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, skip that iteration. (hint: 15 is skipped)
Required Output:

Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
