// Exercise 1:
// Write a function calculator that takes two numbers and a callback function. The callback function should define a mathematical operation (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide), and the calculator function should return the result of applying the callback to the two numbers.

// Exercise 2:
// Create a function stringTransformer that takes a string and a callback function. The callback function should transform the string in the ways 1. capitalize, 2. reverse, and the stringTransformer function should return the transformed string.

// Exercise 3:
// Implement a function repeat that takes a callback function and a number n. The callback function should be executed n times.

// Exercise 4:
// Create a function counter that returns a closure. The closure should be a function that, when called, increments a counter and returns the current count.

// Exercise 5:
// Write a function powerOf that takes an exponent n and returns a function. The returned function should take a base x and calculate x raised to the power of n.

// Exercise 6:
// Create a function accumulator that returns a closure. The closure should be a function that, when called with a number, adds it to the accumulated sum and returns the updated sum.

// Exercise 7:
// Create a function customLogger that returns a closure. The closure should be a function that, when called with a message, logs the message along with a timestamp.
